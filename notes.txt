what is a node js ?
ans : nodejs is a javascript runtime build on google opens ource v8 javascript engine 

when to use node js ?
api with database behind it (preferably nosql)
data streaming 
realtime chat appllication 
server-side web appllication

don't use 
applications with heavy server side processing (cpu-intensive)

//require('fs') module / its is used to read and write the data from the file 
* text =fs.readFileSync('./txt/input.txt','utf-8')   utf-8 to acccess the data from the file if dont put its returns the buffer bytes code 

to write into the other folder 
//fs.writeFileSync('file_path',variable) file is created automatically if you did not created .txt

synchronous also called blocking code code waits before execution for the previous line 
in asynchronous in order to make the code non blocking use asynchronous  

so readFile is the asynchronous method jab tak the readfile function reads the file fully other code will execute and affter reading the file the node js console.log the readed file next

//res.writeHead(404,{'Content-Type':'text/plain',
            'my-own-header':'hello world',
        })

The custom header is likely used for experimental or informational purposes, and the client would be able to see it in the response headers when they inspect the network request.

///res.end(data)   can send an object in the response
