what is a node js ?
ans : nodejs is a javascript runtime build on google opens ource v8 javascript engine 

when to use node js ?
api with database behind it (preferably nosql)
data streaming 
realtime chat application 
server-side web application

don't use 
applications with heavy server side processing (cpu-intensive)

//require('fs') module / its is used to read and write the data from the file 
* text =fs.readFileSync('./txt/input.txt','utf-8')   utf-8 to acccess the data from the file if dont put its returns the buffer bytes code 

to write into the other folder 
//fs.writeFileSync('file_path',variable) file is created automatically if you did not created .txt

synchronous also called blocking code code waits before execution for the previous line 
in asynchronous in order to make the code non blocking use asynchronous  

so readFile is the asynchronous method jab tak the readfile function reads the file fully other code will execute and affter reading the file the node js console.log the readed file next

//res.writeHead(404,{'Content-Type':'text/plain',
            'my-own-header':'hello world',
        })

The custom header is likely used for experimental or informational purposes, and the client would be able to see it in the response headers when they inspect the network request.qA

///res.end(data)   can send an object in the response


//we can make a our own module and export function and use that function in other module 
* in nodejs  every single file is treated as a module 
we shifted replacetemplate to the other folder by 'module.exports '=>this exports the function .and imported by require in index.jsas same name before


introduction to npm
//what is npm(node package manager) ? 
Ans=>npm is a cammand line interface app taht automamtially coming in the nodejs which is used to install and manage the open source packages 

//start new project use npm init =>creates a package.json file which all information of the project is stored


//whatis dependencies 
dependencies are the packages that are required by the project to run the project

a simple dependencies is slugify =>A slug is a URL-friendly version of a string, typically used to create a cleaner, more readable link structure in URLs. In web development, slugs are commonly used to represent the title or name of a page or resource in the URL in a way thatâ€™s easy for both users and search engines to read.


npm i nodemon --save-dev
nodemon is the good package to restart a server whenever we change in the propject 

//how to require third party modules 
const slugify=require('slugify')

Key Features of Slugify:
Removes Special Characters: It removes special characters like punctuation marks and symbols.
Replaces Spaces with Dashes (-): Spaces and other separator characters are replaced with dashes (or other specified characters).
Lowercases the String: Converts the string to lowercase for consistency.
Strips Unsupported Characters: Removes characters that might not work well in URLs (e.g., non-ASCII characters).
